                    Robert Toru Kiyosaki (born April 8, 1947) is an American businessman and author.[1] Kiyosaki is the founder of Rich Global LLC and the Rich Dad Company, a private financial education company that provides personal finance and business education to people through books and videos. The company's main revenues come from franchisees of the Rich Dad seminars that are conducted by independent individuals using Kiyosaki's brand name for a fee.[citation needed] He is also the creator of the Cashflow board and software games to educate adults and children about business and financial concepts.[2]

                    Kiyosaki is the author of more than 26 books, including the international self-published personal finance Rich Dad Poor Dad series of books which has been translated into 51 languages and sold over 41 million copies worldwide. He has been criticized for advocating practices of debatable legality perceived as "get rich quick" philosophy.[3] Kiyosaki is the subject of a class action suit filed by people who attended his seminars and has been the subject of two investigative documentaries by CBC Canada and WTAE USA.[4][5] Kiyosaki's company, Rich Global LLC, filed for bankruptcy in 2012.[6]
